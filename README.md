NOVA is a fully offline, Python-based personal AI chatbot designed to behave like a real human companion. It supports both chat and voice interaction, uses Windows PowerShell Text-to-Speech (Microsoft Zira) for natural voice output, and works without any internet connection. NOVA can remember recent conversations, shift personality moods (funny, chill, sarcastic, serious), tell jokes, answer casual queries, and interact in a friendly, human-like way. The project focuses on logic-based intelligence, response variety, and realistic conversation rather than online APIs or cloud AI.
